## How to use

If you directly click on the webpage, you won't be able to open the ipynb format file, it is a jupyter notebook file format. So you can use jupyter notebook to import the repo dir jupyter_proj.



### Add repo dir jupyter_proj to your  jupyter notebook config file

- config file location

  `C:\Users\xxx\.jupyter\jupyter_notebook_config.py`

- add jupyter_pro dir path in config file

  ```shell
  # c.NotebookApp.notebook_dir = ''
  c.NotebookApp.notebook_dir = r'D:\xxx\jupyter_proj'
  ```
